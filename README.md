## Run the website locally
In order to run the website locally you'll need NodeJS and npm installed on your machine. Once installed:

* Open the directory in your terminal of choice
* Run `npm install`, then `npm run start`

The build task will build the website files, open the website in the browser, and then watch for any changes.
